Experiment 1 – Synthetic Only
Model trained only on synthetic data.
Good performance on synthetic validation data.
Poor generalization to real-world images.

Experiment 2 – Synthetic + Real Data
Adding a small number of real images improved performance on real test data.
Better balance between safe and unsafe predictions.

Experiment 3 – Synthetic + Real Data with Oversampling
Oversampling unsafe samples further improved class balance.
Reduced false negatives at the cost of more false positives.
